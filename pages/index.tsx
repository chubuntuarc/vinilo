          Hi! I&apos;m Jesus, and I love to do software solutions, my focus is
          frontend using NextJS/ReactJS and CSS/SCSS looking for a good job
          paying attention to detail.
          <br />
          <br />I started coding in 2015 with PHP and C# applications, creating
          some custom software for small clients and my intern job, but
          officially I started doing software for bigger clients in 2016 where I
          worked with Pearl for the backend and Bootstrap and JQuery for the
          frontend, I learned the basics of coding.
          {!hiddenText && (
            <>
              <br />
              <br />
              By 2018 I start working with Visual Basic and SQL Server using
              store procedures, a very particular way to code, but I go back to
              web development when I start as a freelancer in my free time,
              working with Firebase, more PHP, and a lot of vanilla JS.
              <br />
              <br />I started in remote work and Shopify in 2019 with an agency
              where our main goal was to fix a lot of issues for the clients, I
              learned a lot about the platform, the basics like liquid, and the
              very fun custom apps development.
              <br />
              <br />
              In 2020 I move to a new job and learned a lot more about Shopify,
              and I started with React and Next (I understood React thanks to
              nextJS ðŸ¤“, here the goal was to migrate from Shopify to headless
              commerce, using Contenfult, a cool experience, a lot of learning.
              <br />
              <br />I continue working with Shopify with a personal client from
              Spain, where I did lot of fixes and updates, and we started with a
              new custom app connected to the Shopify API.
              <br />
              <br /> My latest job was focused on the front end, ReactJS sites,
              and applications, where I learned more about reading requirements
              and organizing my work.
              <br />
              <br />
              And that&apos;s me, always looking for new stuff to learn and cool
              projects to be involved.
              <br />
              <br />
              Thanks for reading :)
